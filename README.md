Cricket-Machine
===============

Easy piece for laptop orchestra.
Originally composed for SCLOrk, the Santa Clara Laptop Orchestra.

## How to play

Open Player file. Adjust paths accordingly to load other files.
Evaluate all lines one by one. Two GUI elements will appear on screen:

1. A little red window called "Cricket"

2. A gray window called "Cricket Control"

As each player clicks on a cricket (red window), a sound is played and the red window fades away. Players should try to chase (click) the next cricket as quickly as possible. Chirps will accumulate over time in an ongoing loop. The goal is to build a soundscape of chirping crickets with the ensemble. Player can make slight adjustments of volume using their audio interface.

A few minutes into the piece, when the texture is much thicker, players can start scratching the cricket loop using "scratch" slider of Cricket Control window (click the "scratch" button to activate scratch mode, then use the slider to scratch). The ensemble may decide what is the right balance between normal chirps and scratched chirps for this section.

The scratched section ends on a cue (given by a conductor or one of the players), when all players should simultaneously click the "transpose one octave below" button in the Cricket Control window.

From that point on, no more scratching (or only very occasionally), and clicking on new crickets is optional. Players slowly fade out to make crickets disappear to end the piece.

## Variations are encouraged!

This is just a guideline for improvisation. The piece can be changed or adapted in a number of ways:

* Players may study the files "Cricket_Collection.scd" and "Cricket_SynthDef.scd" and make changes in the timbre of crickets, or the number of crickets available.

* Different players may be assigned only a subset of available cricket sounds. This might follow some kind of spatial division of the players on stage.

* The ensemble may choose a specific order to introduce each new cricket sound over time.

* Ensembles are encourage to try other variation of the guided improvisation suggested above.

## Improvements for the future

The first version of this piece used SooperLooper for the looping and scratching. Some more work needs to be done to improve the scratching mechanism.

Suggestions and code improvements are welcome.
